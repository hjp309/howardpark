      <p>"Grounded" is a cryptic VR puzzle game where you play as an amnesiac scientist attempting to piece together lost memories of his "great experiment" while
        following instructions from his past self through phonograph recordings. Set in the rural Americas in the 50's, "Grounded" has players scrambling
        through a now unfamiliar home, discovering clues that only make the situation more ominous.

        Developed in a two-man passion project, <i>Grounded's</i> objective was our first exploration in combining VR with storytelling.
        We enjoyed the immersive potential VR had to offer and we had a lot of fun staging the puzzles and environments together in a way where
        it truly felt you were there.

      <h1>Puzzle and Level Design</h1>

      <p>
        There are four puzzles our forgetful scientist had designed to bring back his memories using audio logs scattered around the map.
        <br>
        One of them, as seen from the image below, is a painting that is broken into squares that are scattered around the room, some of them
        requiring the player to open them with a separate lock puzzle or requires further guidance from the audio logs. Solving the paintings
        displays a series of numbers that is used to solve the padlock.
      </p>

<!--
      <p>
        Four puzzles exist in the game and each represent a chapter in the story as completing one rewards players with audio logs or clues
        for the next one. When players are not solving puzzles, they are discovering narrative artifacts placed all around
        the level to give them a better understanding of what is happening around them. Finding this balance between open-world exploration and
        narrative progress was an essential feat for development and definitely gave us a stronger understanding of our players
        through weekly playtest sessions.

        Designing the puzzles was the most strenuous task as we were juggling the balance of effective puzzle design and a narrative
        that seamlessly follows that progression. We designed various events to trigger depending on which puzzle was solved to
        visually and audibly cue narrative progression to the player. Because we were constrained to work with a linear story, we
        had to work around players accidentally solving certain puzzles out of order by placing significant puzzle fragments in areas
        where it would be impossible to discover earlier.

      <p>
        For the "Padlock + Painting" puzzle, for example, paintings were scattered
        all around the house, each with a hidden number that spell out a combination for a lock on a door when put together. Unlocking
        this door triggers a climactic point in the story, so we had two of the paintings locked away in a room that gets unlocked from
        an earlier puzzle. Several red herrings were also placed to make finding this correlation rather difficult. This didn't solve
        the problem of players just going through every single combination on the padlock to eventually unlock it and we left it that way
        for a good reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        For this project, my main role was programming the whole game which includes all of the puzzles, VR interactions, and
        animated sequences.

        <br>
        <br>

        The most important lesson we learned from making this game was user feedback and iterative design tweaking.
        Players were, at first, disoriented by the simple house design and weren't sure where to go next. The house was also too large
        so it prolonged gameplay as well as newer player's motion sickness. Certain objects would seem interactable but are not. And, overall,
        the narrative wasn't well understood because sometimes the puzzles were too hard and pulled them out of the story.

        <br>
        <br>

        As my first puzzle game, it was truly a humbling experience and I had a lot of fun addressing a lot of these issues and eventually
        creating a game that we and the users were eventually proud of.

        <br>

        Although puzzle games are not my passion, what I want to convey through this project was that I'm always willing to try new things
        and am obsessed with narrative.

      <p>
        If you carefully observe where each puzzle's pieces are placed in the map, you will notice that no matter where you path, there is
        always enough information to tease the existence of a puzzle but not enough to offer a viable solution. Solving the padlock first
        leads you to a bookcase which can immediately be solved if you realize to place the book in it to reveal the room with a flamethrower.
        However, you will not be able to make it past the end-game door as there is another lock that needs to be opened. This prompts the
        existence of a key but does not tell you where it is, saving the satisfying "AHA" moment as a reward for later when discovery of a hammer
        redirects your attention to a fragile vase from the room you passed by earlier. It was our creed that "good puzzles are about
        obfuscation, not obscuration". To make a puzzle rewarding, enough information needs to be relayed to reward those who figure
        it out, not to those who "found the key" or "found the book". Placing a key on the table to a lock in front of is not a satisfying puzzle,
        but using a padlock of numbers you pieced together from a series of unusually similar paintings is.

      <h1>Narrative Approach</h1>

      <p>
        Though not a popular argument, I believe that there are some aspects of games that make them unreliable mediums for stories.
        A person's story, once gamified, will not pan out the same for every reader in control and, thus, produces a slightly different
        narrative each time. What we allow for our stories to compensate for this lack of linearity is the ability to time-travel and alter
        these circumstances while still abiding by the laws of that universe. Because players are free to explore and free to solve puzzles
        in any order they want, the narrative is simplified to fragments - triggers and environmental pieces that provide an experience that
        isn't always intended to players. And that's the price that we had to pay to sustain a proactive puzzle experience that doesn't funnel
        solutions through a mere "A to B, B to C" progression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, event triggers that activated subtle pieces of the narrative upon puzzle completion are designed to be in no chronological
        order and are expressive forms of the story. How we decided to project our story is by slowly introducing the experiment the
        farmer had created. Incorporating some methods of horror, we wanted to make players feel uneased by making the house as
        eery as possible. This included the lack of windows, dim lighting, very low-pitched ambience, and a claustrophobic house design that
        has exploration eventually come to a dead-end after a dedicated amount of time. As for the presence of life, we went for the "breathing
        house" feel where occasional noises will prompt players to look over their shoulder and subtle changes in the environment will have
        players questioning their sanity. The more triggers activated, the more these sorts of things would happen. However, we wanted to
        ensure that players ended the game satisfied, so we decided not to put in any jump-scares and, instead, hold the feeling of the potential
        existence of one which was honestly more effective if anything. In the end, we had fun doing this and we learned that fear functions
        in very different ways.
      </p>

      <h1>Motion Sickness in VR</h1>

      <p>
        One of the biggest problems that we failed to overlook was how much motion sickness affects quality gameplay experiences. During
        most playtest sessions, there were people that were not able to get passed the second or third puzzle due to the amount of time it
        took being plugged in and the lower threshold for newer VR users. A lot of this problem had to do with the fluctuating frame rates
        as we were using weaker machines, and the fact that movement had to be simulated by joystick rather than the player's actual feet.
        The amount of wires needed to use the Oculus Rift also made it dangerous for users to use their actual heads to turn around which
        exacerbated the issue when we decided to use the right joystick for head turning as the replacement. There were many ways we could've
        suppressed the problem, but ultimately there wasn't a viable solution that would make not using virtual reality at all a reasonable one.
        There are many iterations that I'd like to try for VR controls in the future should the time come where I could get my hands on one again.
        But until then, I will continue to use my newfound knowledge to develop games that realize <b>user experience starts from the moment
        the players touch the controller.</b>
