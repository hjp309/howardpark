      Hello! My name is Howard Park and welcome to my very own website!
      <br><br>I am 23 years old and currently looking for work as a Unity Developer or Unity Programmer. Since 2016, I've made Unity my aspiration and have been consistently looking for opportunities to learn and limit-test my abilities to deliver awesome user experiences. I come from a programming background (C#, C++, Python, Javascript) with experience in product design (UX/UI), which has allowed me to tackle various projects including Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, mobile apps, and online multiplayer.
      <br><br>One of the projects I am currently working on is an AR app that allows users to capture themselves fiddling with AR facial tracking, body tracking, object placements, and 3D drawing. I've also created a motion-tracking bunny stomping game that will hopefully see activity once our pitch is successful!
      <br><br>With this pandemic bringing everyone online, I would love to take this opportunity to connect with as many developers, Unity-lovers, and recruiters ;) as possible. Also, if anyone would like to participate in a few game jams, I am always available for a chat!


      <br><br>

      I would love to connect with other fellow Unity developers, tech workers, and gamers that share the same passions for tech as me
      and build some cool things together! :)
